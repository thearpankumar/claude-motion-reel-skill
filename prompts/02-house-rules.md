# Chapter 2: The house rules (CLAUDE.md)

The rules every later chapter relies on: the seek(t) render contract, the banned look, the beat grid, and the critique loop.

# Motion studio rules

## Render contract
- Every film is a pure function of time: window.seek(t) paints frame t.
- No CSS transitions, no setTimeout, no requestAnimationFrame in render mode, no state carried between frames. Seeded noise only (mulberry32), never Math.random.
- Render with node render.mjs, encode H.264 yuv420p, CRF 16.

## Look
- Banned defaults: centered title on gradient, everything fading in, corner labels and frame borders, glow on UI chrome, generic particle bursts.
- One display face, one UI face. One accent color unless the brief says otherwise.
- Every 2 to 4 seconds something new must happen on screen.

## Sound
- Score and SFX are synthesized in code unless a track is supplied.
- Place hits on the measured beat grid (beats.json). Loudness -14 LUFS.

## Loop before you show me anything
1. Render one frame per beat as a contact sheet and LOOK at it.
2. Score it 1-10 on: hook in first 2s, readability at phone size, motion quality, variety, brand accuracy, sound sync.
3. Fix the 3 worst problems. Repeat until every score is 8+.
4. Only then do the full render.

This kit's `CLAUDE.md` is this text plus the springs-only and banned-cliché rules that were added in later chapters.
